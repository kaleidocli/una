**D E S C R I P T I O N**
**>** A moderator aka 'host'. Cannot participate in any activities in the game, is prohibited from interfering the game.
**>** By default, the host is bot-CLI (autohost). You can use `-assign gm` to make yourself one.
**>** If there's a GM, only GMs can use  `-setcard` `-start` `-addtime`, with some other `..` cmds. Plus, as a GM, `-stt` will provide more specific info about the players (roles etc.).
**>** Please note that GM is the real host, the bot is nothing but a tool for you to run the game more easily. All the decision on living and deaths is made by GM, so please be responsible.

**G U I D E**
**>** There are *two* phases in the game, **day** and **night**. Thoughout the game, GMs need to provide all the info to the bot so that it can fully functional.
---------- **NIGHT** ----------
**>>** During **the night**, the bot will ask each role in DM and their action (biting, protecting..) will be recorded and messaged to GM.
**>>** Based on the log, GM now needs to decide who's dead, who lives, by using one of the following method.
**>>>** `..botkill` == automatic killing || `..kill [player's name] [..]` == manual killing (please note that both method can't be undone once inited).
**>>** At the end of the night, GM could choose `..end` to end the game, or `..next` to move to the next phase (day).
----------- **DAY** -----------
**>>** At the beginning of **day** phase, *players* will vote for someone they want to hang. GMs please remind them to do that, and GMs *can't vote*.
**>>** Once *everyone* has used their vote, a votes-count status box will be displayed, and only GM can call it again using `..vote`.
**>>** Now is the time for the highest-voted one to **defend** oneself, to **persuade** others change their vote to someone he/she wants. Players can change vote simply by `-vote` someone else.
**>>** Once someone is sure dead, GMs can hang that one using `..next`. Then, GMs can choose to end game - `..end`, or to move to next day- `..next`.
